                    <h2>5: Root</h2>
                    <p>
                        Root is really fun game with cartoonish art.

                    <h2>4: Brass</h2>
                    <p style="max-width: 700px;">
                        Brass is really cool looking game but it too dark to see most of the details. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>3: Gloom Haven</h2>
                    <p style="max-width: 700px;">
                        This game is the best RPG board game out there, the role playing and the story telling is just amazing, it's too bad most of the art is on the box then in the game or I would of put this higher on the list.

                    <h2>2: Wingspan</h2>
                    <p style="max-width: 700px;">
                        Wingspan is a great game with really nice art. Most of the art is illustrations of birds, and the boards look just as good as well.

                    <h2>1: Scythe</h2>
                    <p style="max-width: 700px;">
